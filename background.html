					<li>Days 6 and after: $10 fee/day</li>
						<li class= "tab">	-Untill the market value of the item(s) + 50% of the total market value has been paid by the Rentee</li>
						<li class= "tab">	-The market value of the item(s) will be given to the Renter</li>
						<li class= "tab">	-The 50% fee will be kept by The Traveling Closet</li>

				Hey, I am 16 years old and a rising junior at Josephinum Academy. My first experience with coding was through a summer program called Girls Who Code. I really enjoyed it and it has inspired me to continue to learn more. On my free time i like to play soccer or volleyball. I also like to hang out with friends, watch netflix, and try new things here and there. Another thing that I like is mexican and chinese food. I am looking forward to explore more about coding, learning, and having fun with it.

				I’m a 16 year old part-time student at Moraine Valley Community College in Palos Hills, a suburb right outside of chicago. I got started in coding when I took part in the Girls Who Code summer immersion program after my sophomore year of high school, and now I only want to keep learning about computer science. Outside of coding, I like to play violin, go out and ride my bike, and binge watch stuff on Netflix. I hope that I am able to shape my life in a way where I’m constantly learning and growing, and I look forward to seeing this website grow and pursuing the things that I’m passionate about and the things that make me happy.

				I’m a 16 year-old rising junior at Marist High School in Chicago, Illinois. I first got my start in coding when I took a computer science class at my school sophomore year. I then came across a Girls Who Code application with the help of my Computer Science teacher. Little did I know it would be the best experience of my life. Girls Who Code gave me an outlet and brought out my passion in computer science. When I’m not coding, I’m watching netflix, jamming to music, playing the guitar or hanging out with friends. I love food and hopefully get the chance to travel the world to try all the best restaurants. I’m looking forward to trying new things and never stop learning.
