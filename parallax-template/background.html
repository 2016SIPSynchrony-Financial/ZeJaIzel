			<h5> Rental Insurance Policy </h5>
				<p>We do not have formal insurance on our clothes so far. However, anyone renting clothing is required to provide us with credit/debit card information. When the date of return approaches, the rentee will be notified. If the return date has passed and the item(s) have not been marked as returned by the renter, the rentee will be billed through their provided monetary information. Our formal billing policy is as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Days 1-5 after deadline: $1 fee/day</li>
						<li class= "tab">	-This fee will be kept by The Traveling Closet</li>
					<li>Days 6 and after: $10 fee/day</li>
						<li class= "tab">	-Untill the market value of the item(s) + 50% of the total market value has been paid by the Rentee</li>
						<li class= "tab">	-The market value of the item(s) will be given to the Renter</li>
						<li class= "tab">	-The 50% fee will be kept by The Traveling Closet</li>
					<li>If the clothing item is returned, cleaned and without damage, 15 days or less after the deadline, the Rentee will be elligable to receive 50% of the money that has been paid by the date returned. 
						<li class= "tab">	-The other 50% of money paid will be given to the Renter as compensation</li>
					<li>*Note: Rentee refers to the person borrowing the clothing, and Renter is the owner of the clothing</li>

			<h5> What Are ClosetCoins(CC) ? </h5>
				<p> ClosetCoins are the currency of The Traveling Closet, which allow you to rent clothing. They were developed to encourage the availability of clothes on the website, so there would be about as many clothes available as there are checked out. Each item's value in ClosetCoins is determined by category and condition. Deterioration in the condition of an item, then, may result in a decrease in its CC value. We try to keep all item values under 20CC on average and under 30CC overall, to allow for accessibility. Every user starts with 100 closet coins. After that, renting out or donating clothes to our partners earns closet coins. The CC value earned per item is determined the same way as clothes already on the site. The CC earned will be change depending on the item's value, however, renting out items earns a bonus in CC equivalent to 5% of the items value, to encourage the  availability of clothing for rental.
				In the future we also hope that ClosetCoins over a certain amount may be redeemed for coupons to your favourite clothing stores.

				Hey, I am 16 years old and a rising junior at Josephinum Academy. My first experience with coding was through a summer program called Girls Who Code. I really enjoyed it and it has inspired me to continue to learn more. On my free time i like to play soccer or volleyball. I also like to hang out with friends, watch netflix, and try new things here and there. Another thing that I like is mexican and chinese food. I am looking forward to explore more about coding, learning, and having fun with it.

				I’m a 16 year old part-time student at Moraine Valley Community College in Palos Hills, a suburb right outside of chicago. I got started in coding when I took part in the Girls Who Code summer immersion program after my sophomore year of high school, and now I only want to keep learning about computer science. Outside of coding, I like to play violin, go out and ride my bike, and binge watch stuff on Netflix. I hope that I am able to shape my life in a way where I’m constantly learning and growing, and I look forward to seeing this website grow and pursuing the things that I’m passionate about and the things that make me happy.

				I’m a 16 year-old rising junior at Marist High School in Chicago, Illinois. I first got my start in coding when I took a computer science class at my school sophomore year. I then came across a Girls Who Code application with the help of my Computer Science teacher. Little did I know it would be the best experience of my life. Girls Who Code gave me an outlet and brought out my passion in computer science. When I’m not coding, I’m watching netflix, jamming to music, playing the guitar or hanging out with friends. I love food and hopefully get the chance to travel the world to try all the best restaurants. I’m looking forward to trying new things and never stop learning.
